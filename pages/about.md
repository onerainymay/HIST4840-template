## Description

In our latest episode, we explore the history of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and The Bay, a department store familiar to most Canadians, through a public history angle. By exploring relationship dynamics between the HBC and those involved in the fur trade, how the Bay interacts with its history, as well as preservation and reconciliation efforts, we hope to shed light on the company's complex history and the ways in which identity narratives are framed. A special thanks to professor Carolyn Podruchny for sharing her insight with us to be featured in this episode!
